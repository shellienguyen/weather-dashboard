About:
------
This page provides a weather dashboard where users can look up the current weather for a city.

Project Goal:
-------------
To provide travelers with a weather dashboard that displays the current weather to a requested city.
Upon page load, the page will display the weather information for the last searched city, if that information is available.
When the user inputs a city name, the page will display the city name, current date, current temperature,
current humidity, current windspeed, and the current UV Index.  The UV Index will be color coded based on
the level of severity:
  - Green color for UVI 1-2
  - Yellow color for UVI 3-5
  - Orange color for UVI 6-7
  - Red color for UVI 8-10
  - Purple for UVI 11+

The page will also provide a 5-day forecast and a list of historical search listing the last 10 searched cities.
The user can also click on any city on the history list to search for the forecast for that city again.
